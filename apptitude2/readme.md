Hi intrapair!

Task 2

This task is aimed to test my knowledge of Hash Table in Data Structures and algorithms and as I have rightly stated, I have little to no knowledge of DSA but I have managed to find solution to the task with the help of resources online


The task is to write a function that takes a string as an argument and returns the first recurring character in the string, or null if there is no recurring character.

For example:

If the input string is "acbbac", the first recurring character is "b," so the function should return "b."
If the input string is "abcdef", there are no recurring characters, so the function should return null


The 'findFirstRecurringCharacter' function takes a string 'str' as input and finds the first recurring character in the string. It uses an object (charMap) as a hash table to keep track of characters encountered so far. The function iterates through the string and returns the first recurring character it finds, or null if there are no recurring characters.


HOW TO RUN THE CODE

From the folder, Open the terminal and navigate to apptitude2 then type 'node app.js' to the console
